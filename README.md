# Situated Knowledges and Partial Perspectives:  A Framework for Radical Objectivity in Computational Social Science and Computational Humanities

Welcome! This repository includes the data and code needed to reproduce the analyses and figures in the paper ["Situated Knowledges and Partial Perspectives:  A Framework for Radical Objectivity in Computational Social Science and Computational Humanities"](https://www.lauraknelson.com/publication/radical-objectivity/), published in *New Literary History* in June 2023.  

Published paper here: https://muse.jhu.edu/article/898331  
Open version here: https://www.lauraknelson.com/publication/radical-objectivity/  

To run this code you will need:

    Python and the Python libraries gensin, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn
    Jupyter

**** See the requirements.txt file for specific versions of the libraries used ****

The data file (in the data folder) contains a word2vec model trained on the collections ["First Person Narratives of the American South"](https://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/) and ["North American Slave Narratives"](https://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/), from the library [*Documenting the American South*](https://docsouth.unc.edu/index.html), housed at Duke University.

A copy of the raw data can be found here: https://github.com/lknelson/measuring_intersectionality/tree/main/data

The code that generated the word2vec model (`word2vec_all_clean.txt`) can be found here: https://github.com/lknelson/measuring_intersectionality

Happy coding!
